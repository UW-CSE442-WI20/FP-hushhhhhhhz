              I did what no presenter should ever do: I watched my own talk.<br/><br/>My first visit to OpenVis Conf in 2013.

          <section class="step">
            <div id="title2"><h3>Stream Ciphers</h3></div>
   				In a stream cipher, the encryption rule depends on a plaintext symbol's position in the stream of plaintext symbols. 
				<br/><br/>
				One early stream cipher is the Vigenere, credited to the diplomat of King Charles IX, Blaise de Vigenere. 
				<br/><br/>
				It follows the convention where letters are labeled based on their position within the alphabet: A = 0, B = 1, ... Z = 25
				<br/><br/>
				Plaintext (P) and keytext (C) are then added together to produce a ciphertext (C) using the following equation:
				<br/><br/>
				C = P + K mod 26

          <section class="step">
            <div class="title3"><h3>Block Ciphers</h3></div>
            	In a block cipher, you encrypt several plaintext symbols at once in a block.
				<br/><br/>
				A famous block cipher is Playfair, which was invented in England in 1854 by Sir Charles Wheatstone, who it demonstrated to Baron Playfair, who then explained it to Prince Albert and future Prime Minister Viscount Palmerston.

              And here are all the fillers I used in those 30 minutes.
          </section>

          <section class="step">
            <div class="title5"><h3>Schemes</h3></div>
              I almost exclusively used these three fillers. Um's and Ah's made up over 80%, with Uh's trailing behind.
          </section>

          <section class="step">
            <div class="title6"><h4>Symmetric Keys</h4></div>
              I hoped that all these blunders were toward the beginning of my talk. And the data suggests that fewer fillers are used as I get into it. Perhaps the talk started out rough and improved as I found my groove.
          </section>

          <section class="step">
            <div class="title7"><h4>Asymmetric Keys</h4></div>
              Unfortunately, the trend does not continue. Midway into the talk my Um's and Ah's spike. I continue to use them pretty consistently throughout the rest of the talk.
          </section>

          <section class="step">
            <div class="title8"> <h4>Hash Encryption & RSA</h4></div>
              My theory is that at this critical halfway point in my talk, I heard a dry cough indicative of the audience's waning interest. This caused self-confidence to collapse and forced me out of my groove.<br/><br/>A competing theory is that I just hadn't practiced the last half of my speech as much.
