            <h3>Stream Ciphers</h3>
          </div>
          In a stream cipher, the encryption rule depends on a plaintext symbol's position in the stream of plaintext
          symbols.
          <br><br>
          One early stream cipher is the Vigenere, credited to the diplomat of King Charles IX, Blaise de Vigenere.
          <br><br>
          It follows the convention where letters are labeled based on their position within the alphabet: A = 0, B = 1,
          ... Z = 25
          <br><br>
          Plaintext (P) and keytext (C) are then added together to produce a ciphertext (C) using the following
          equation:
          <br><br>
          C = P + K mod 26
		  <br><br>
		  Keys and messages can be any length, but when encoding/decoding they must be the same length. For example, "message" is 7 letters while "key" 
		  only 3. We therefore repeat "key" until it is the same length as "message".
		  <br><br>
		  Watch on the right as we calculate our ciphertext.

            <h3>Block Ciphers</h3>
          </div>
          <p>A famous block cipher is Playfair, which was invented in England in 1854 by Sir Charles Wheatstone, who it
          demonstrated to Baron Playfair, who then explained it to Prince Albert and future Prime Minister Viscount
          Palmerston.</p>
          <!-- <br /><br /> -->

          <p>Block ciphers encrypts by pairs of letters, instead of single letters like in a stream cipher.</p>
          <!-- <br /><br /> -->

          <p>Playfair starts with creating a key table. The key table is a 5Ã—5 grid of letters that 
          will act as the key for encrypting your plaintext. Each of the 25 letters must be unique and one letter 
          of the alphabet (one that is least common like Q) is omitted from the table - we chose to ommit J.</p>
          <!-- <br /><br /> -->

          <p>The message is split into pairs of letters, and we use both letters to encrypt.</p>
          <p>There are 3 main rules that are followed:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>if the letters are in the same column, take the letter below each one</li>
            <li>if the letters are in the same row, take the letter to the right of each one</li>
            <li>if neighter of the proceeding rules are true, form a rectangle with the two letters and take the letters on the horizontal opposite corner of the rectangle</li>
          </ol>
		  <p> Watch on the right as we walk through these three rules and then encrypt our "secret".</p>
