            <div id="title1"><h2>History of Encryption</h2></div>
              I did what no presenter should ever do: I watched my own talk.<br><br>My first visit to OpenVis Conf in 2013.
          </section>

          <section class="step">
            <div id="title2"><h3>Stream Ciphers</h3></div>
              As expected, I could only focus on the flaws: the rushed speech, the odd phrases, and, most especially, all the filler words. In fact, I found 180 filler words in my 30 minute talk.
          </section>

          <section class="step">
            <div class="title3"><h3>Block Ciphers</h3></div>
              Here are all 5,040 words of my talk.
          </section>

          <section class="step">
            <div class="title4"><h2>Modern Encryption</h2></div>
              And here are all the fillers I used in those 30 minutes.
          </section>

          <section class="step">
            <div class="title5"><h3>Schemes</h3></div>
              I almost exclusively used these three fillers. Um's and Ah's made up over 80%, with Uh's trailing behind.
          </section>

          <section class="step">
            <div class="title6"><h4>Symmetric Keys</h4></div>
              I hoped that all these blunders were toward the beginning of my talk. And the data suggests that fewer fillers are used as I get into it. Perhaps the talk started out rough and improved as I found my groove.
          </section>

          <section class="step">
            <div class="title7"><h4>Asymmetric Keys</h4></div>
              Unfortunately, the trend does not continue. Midway into the talk my Um's and Ah's spike. I continue to use them pretty consistently throughout the rest of the talk.
          </section>

          <section class="step">
            <div class="title8"> <h4>Hash Encryption & RSA</h4></div>
              My theory is that at this critical halfway point in my talk, I heard a dry cough indicative of the audience's waning interest. This caused self-confidence to collapse and forced me out of my groove.<br><br>A competing theory is that I just hadn't practiced the last half of my speech as much.
